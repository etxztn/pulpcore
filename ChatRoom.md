**The chatroom hasn't been working (Jaabber problem?), and it's been rather empty anyway, so I'm disabling it for now**

## Chatroom ##
In addition to the [Discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/pulpcore), a Jabber chatroom is available, and there's usually a few people logged in.

Join the PulpCore chatroom at <a href='xmpp:pulpcore@conference.jabber.org?join'>xmpp:pulpcore@conference.jabber.org?join</a>

Many IM clients can access Jabber (iChat, Adium, PSI, Miranda, Fire, etc). If you prefer IRC, you can install [BitlBee](http://www.bitlbee.org/) to login to Jabber, or access a [BitlBee public server](http://www.bitlbee.org/main.php/servers.html).
